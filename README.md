and you're good to go. after a short initial setup the program is ready to use

### opening multiple bids in ucx
This was the reason for this program, the idea is simple. Loads of BIDS all opening at once.

enter the locale in the format of a country code e.g DE for germany

The program seperates the bids by spaces, so make sure they have at least one space between them (new lines are fine).

like this:

8xzh1cm2bm86 8qcqtbnrtmfh 8znk82972g53 90bm332zz4nh 8pt2qf71z32q 8nvs9k3bfbnv

or this:

8xzh1cm2bm86
8qcqtbnrtmfh
8znk82972g53
90bm332zz4nh
8pt2qf71z32q
8nvs9k3bfbnv

select the destination from the dropdown menu and then click 'open link'

### opening multiple locales in ucx

This works much in the way as the above example, the only difference is that you have one bid and your country codes seperated by spaces.

like this:

DE IE FR NB

### live site
live site works just like the first example, with one difference. unlike ucx the MS Live site requires a language and a country code.

like this:

en-gb

### more features?
so far this does everything i need it to do, but if anyone actually ends up using this and need further functionality shoot me an email
